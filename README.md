# In The Meowment

In The Meowment is a site that introduces a cat cafe and hopes to make the visitor curious and to entice them to visit the actual cafe. The site is targeted towards cat lovers, and especially people who either can't have a cat of their own, so they can socialize at the cafe, or who want to adopt a cat. It informs about the different amenities of the cafe, introduces the cats and gives impressions.

## Design

### Colors

The main goal of the color palette was to make a cozy, inviting impression on the visitor, without being too extreme. 

I also wanted to have a color palette connected to the cat theme of the page. I found a [color palette](https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1199229/calico_cutie) inspired by the multicolored calico cats which almost fit the needs. 

I felt that the black in the palette was too extreme and could be softened by a dark brown. I found a matching dark brown browsing through a color palette generator page using the dark brown in the [Discreet palette](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D49D4E&sub=1), ending up with the following colors:

### Fonts

In general, I wanted fonts that did not seem too strict or edgy, since the site is supposed to be welcoming and cozy and a bit casual. 

As with the colors, I wanted to have a cat-related font for the logo of the site. I found the font ["Meows"](https://www.fontspace.com/meows-font-f48581) created by Nur Aisyah Amalia and made available for non-commercial use via fontspace.com. 

I originally planned to use it for other headings as well, but decided against it after the first styling, since it was a little overwhelming. 

For all other text, I chose the font Ubuntu from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), since it fit well with Meows and fit my initial idea about the font.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
