# In The Meowment

[In The Meowment](https://hashtag-squirrel.github.io/in-the-meowment) is a site that introduces a cat cafe and hopes to make the visitor curious and to entice them to visit the actual cafe. The site is targeted towards cat lovers, and especially people who either can't have a cat of their own, so they can socialize at the cafe, or who want to adopt a cat. It informs about the different amenities of the cafe, introduces the cats and gives impressions.

## UX

### Goals

The site has the following main business goals:

1. Entice site visitors to visit the cafe in person and spend time and money there.
2. Introduce the cats and convince people to adopt a cat.

It fulfills these goals by doing the following things:

- Showing the visitor a cozy, welcoming atmosphere
- Showing off the cats in the cafe as a special incentive to come visit
- Giving information about how to reach the cafe both on- and offline
- Giving further information about amenities and the food and drinks on offer
- Providing opportunity for the visitor to apply for adoption of a cat
- Giving the visitor many impressions of the cafe, making it more likely that the visitor wants to visit 

### User Stories

As a first time site user I want to: 

* find information about the cafe and how to find it
* Find a list of offered drinks and food
* Find information about the cats
* Find out how to adopt a cat

As a returning site user I want to:

* Apply to adopt a cat I have met

As a business I want:

* My customers to find anything they need to know about the cafe
* My customers to have a convenient way to apply for a adoption
* My customers to feel invited to come visit

### Design

#### Colors

The main goal of the color palette was to make a cozy, inviting impression on the visitor, without being too extreme. 

I also wanted to have a color palette connected to the cat theme of the page. I found a [color palette](https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1199229/calico_cutie) inspired by the multicolored calico cats which almost fit the needs. 

I felt that the black in the palette was too extreme and could be softened by a dark brown. I found a matching dark brown browsing through a color palette generator page using the dark brown in the [Discreet palette](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D49D4E&sub=1), ending up with the following colors:

![Color Palette](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/color-palette.png)

#### Fonts

In general, I wanted fonts that did not seem too strict or edgy, since the site is supposed to be welcoming and cozy and a bit casual. 

As with the colors, I wanted to have a cat-related font for the logo of the site. I found the font ["Meows"](https://www.fontspace.com/meows-font-f48581) created by Nur Aisyah Amalia and made available for non-commercial use via fontspace.com. 

I originally planned to use it for other headings as well, but decided against it after the first styling, since it was a little overwhelming. 

For all other text, I chose the font Ubuntu from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), since it fit well with Meows and fit my initial idea about the font. 

#### Consistency

In order to keep a consistent look throughout all pages of the site, there are recurring design elements on every page. 

- All boxes that don't stretch over the whole width of the screen have rounded borders with 10px
- Circles and rounded boxes show up in different parts of the page
- All borders used throughout the page have a consistent thickness of 2px
- Margins were mostly kept at two sizes of 15px and 30px
- The header and footer sections appear on every page in the same styling

#### Images

The imagery used throughout the site was chosen to match the theme of the site and features cats, coffee or both in the same image. 

The hero images were chosen to match the specific content of the page they are displayed on. The images in the gallery are supposed to give a good impression of what a stay at the cafe can be like, showing people cuddling cats and cats hanging out in cozy settings, as well as showing drinks and cafe scenery. 

The images of people holding or cuddling cats were added specifically to make a visitor more likely to picture themselves coming to the cafe and holding or cuddling a cat and thus making it more likely for them to visit. 

Most images were taken from free stock image pages and are credited in detail [here](#credits).
The images of the Gigi and Klaire belong to myself and the images of Nika and Nova were kindly donated by our neighbours who would like to remain anonymous. 

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar and logo are featured on every page in a consistent style to allow for easy navigation across the site. 
  - The logo is a clickable link to the home page.
  - The navigation links are highlighted when the user hovers over them to give them a sense of feedback.
  - The active page is highlighted with a dark background so the user always knows where on the page he is at the moment.

![Nav Bar](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-nav-bar.png)

- __The landing page hero image__

  - Like every page, the landing features a photograph that is supposed to elicit positive feelings in the user.
  - There is a text box overlay as well, with a call to action to visit the cafe and giving extra incentive ("getting your MEOW on").

![Landing Page](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-landing.png)

- __About section__

  - The About section shows the user information about the different benefits of the cafe.
  - Every line of text is written in an imperative tone in order to prompt the user to do the things themselves.
  - It has a playful circle design with icons to give an impression of the possibilities at the cafe at first glance.

![About](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-about.png)

- __Contact section__

  - The Contact section offers the user information about how to find the cafe.
  - It is offset from the About section using a dark background in the primary color, so it is clear that this is a new section.
  - It is divided into two columns:
    - In the first column, the user finds the address, phone number and email address.
    - In the second column, there is an interactive map showing the location of the cafe at first glance, so the user doesn't have to enter the address in another map tool if they are not familiar with the address.

![Contact](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-contact.png)

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section features links to the different social media accounts of the cafe using simple icons for the different sites. 
  - The links open to a new tab so the user is not directed away from the page, but can keep browsing. 
  - The design was kept as minimalistic as possible to not distract from the rest of the content, but at the same time offer easy and intuitive access.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media, where they may find more current information or more impressions of the cafe. This applies especially for users who are looking to adopt a cat and want to stay informed about new cats arriving or the cats' progress.

![Footer](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-footer.png)

- __The Menu page hero image__

  - To keep a consistent look throughout the page as mentioned above, the Menu page also features a large photograph with an overlayed text box.
  - The image chosen shows a person holding a cup of cappuccino, which is supposed to give another visual clue as to where on the site the user is and what the page is about.
  - The text box gives a written headline for the page, trying to get a positive emotional response from the user by using a cat-themed pun to describe the items on offer ("Purrtastic").

![Menu Hero](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-menu-hero.png)

- __Menu section__

  - The Menu section gives the user a list of drinks and food offered at the cafe.
  - The value for the user is that they know exactly if the cafe offers something they would like to have and to make their selection at the cafe easier.
  - Additionally, the page aims at enticing more users to visit the cafe because they spot something on offer they really like.
  - The menu has a few items using cat-themed puns, again to get a positive emotional response from the user.
  - The menu itself is contained in two rounded-corner boxes which are offset from the background by using the primary color.

![Menu Section](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-menu.png)

- __The Cats page hero image__

  - The photograph features in the hero image on the Cats page shows a large open room with cat furniture and cats hidden in my parts of the photo. The room shown is open and flooded by light, creating an inviting atmosphere.
  - This is supposed to give the user an impression of the cats, while also showing off the cafe itself.
  - The text box again features a call to action to meet the cats, using the adjective "lovely" to make the user more inclined to meet them.

![Cats Hero](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-cats-hero.png)

- __Cats section__

  - Similar in styling with the About section on the landing page, this section features the cats living at the cafe.
  - The circles show a portrait of each kitty with an adjoining text box containing their name and a short description of them.
  - The user can get familiar with the cats here before visiting or can remind themselves of the cats they met when they visited the cafe before.
  - A user interested in adoption can use the page to revisit the cat they are interested in.

![Cats Section](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-cats.png)

- __Gallery__

  - The Gallery section gives the user more impressions of the cafe.
  - When hovering over an image, it zooms in a little, to give focus to the image hovered over.
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to envision their stay at the cafe.

![Gallery](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-gallery.png)

- __The Adopt page hero image__

  - The Adopt page hero image shows a goofy photograph of a cat on a stool, so the user can visualize what a cat in their home may look like.
  - The text box does not have a call to action, but instead it has a question to the user, suggesting that adopting a cat will equal love in their home.

![Adopt Hero](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-adopt-hero.png)

- __The Adoption Form__

  - This page will allow the user to apply to adopt one of the cats of the cafe.
  - The user will be able to choose which cat they are interested in.
  - The user will be asked to submit their full name, phone number and email address.
  - Additionally, the user is asked to write a small paragraph about who they are and why they want to adopt.
  - The fields are all required and have input validation for the input type.

![Adopt Section](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-adopt.png)

- __404 page__

  - If the user should end up on a non-existing link, they are shown the 404 page
  - The page gives a written explanation that the page doesn't exist
  - The page also shows a sad cat to keep with the theme of the page
  - The value of the page is that the user still has the navigation bars, so they can easily navigate back to existing content

![404 Page](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/in-the-meowment-404.png)

### Feature Ideas

- Clicking on the featured cats to open a modal with a longer description and details about the cat
- A page showing new arrivals

On an earlier test, I received an error from the CSS validator about the scale property being used on the #error-image. I then found [this solution](https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1091) for it on the internet and changed my code accordingly. 

### Lighthouse Testing

![Lighthouse Test](https://github.com/hashtag-squirrel/in-the-meowment/blob/main/assets/images/readme-media/lighthouse-testing.png)

### Desktop Testing

All pages were extensively tested on Chrome Version 109.0.5414.119, since this was the browser used when building the project. 

Further testing was done on current versions of Edge, Opera and Safari, where all pages were looked at at different screen widths.
Testing on Internet Explorer was not done since IE is not supported anymore. 

### Mobile Testing

Mobile testing was done on iPhone 12 pro and iPhone 14 pro. 

Android devices were tested using the Developer tools of the browser, since no Android device was available in physical form.
